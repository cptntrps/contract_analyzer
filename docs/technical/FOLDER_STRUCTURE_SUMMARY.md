## Key Improvements

### âœ… **Organized Source Code**
- All Python source files moved to dedicated `src/` directory
- Relative imports implemented for better modularity
- Clear separation between application code and infrastructure

### âœ… **Output Management**
- Test results now saved in `output/test-results/` instead of root
- Logs organized in `output/logs/` directory
- Coverage reports in `output/coverage/`
- Build artifacts in `output/artifacts/`

### âœ… **Configuration Management**
- All configuration files consolidated in `config/` directory
- Environment-specific settings properly organized
- Test configuration accessible at project root for discovery

### âœ… **Data Organization**
- User data (uploads, templates, reports) in dedicated `data/` directory
- Clear separation between application data and generated output
- Better security and backup management

### âœ… **Script Organization**
- All utility scripts in dedicated `scripts/` directory
- Wrapper scripts in root for easy access
- Proper import path management

## Files Modified

### **Moved Files (25 files)**
- **Source code**: 8 files moved to `src/`
- **Scripts**: 5 files moved to `scripts/`
- **Configuration**: 5 files moved to `config/`

### ðŸ“‹ **Verification Steps**
1. **Import validation**: All source modules import correctly
2. **Server startup**: Dashboard server launches successfully
3. **Path validation**: All configured paths resolve correctly
4. **Log generation**: Logs save to correct output directory
5. **Structure validation**: All directories created properly

## Usage

### **Start Application**
```bash
# From project root
python start_dashboard.py

# Or directly from scripts
python scripts/start_dashboard.py
```

### **Run Tests**
```bash
# From project root
python run_tests.py

# Or directly from scripts  
python scripts/run_tests.py
```

### **Development**
```bash
# All source code in src/
# All scripts in scripts/
# All config in config/
# All output in output/
```

## Future Considerations

### **Potential Enhancements**
- Add `build/` directory for distribution packages
- Implement proper packaging with `setup.py`
- Add CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Enhance output management with automatic cleanup

### **Maintenance**
- Regular cleanup of `output/` directories
- Monitor directory sizes
- Update documentation as needed
- Review structure periodically

## Summary

The folder structure optimization was successful and provides:
- âœ… **Professional organization** following Python best practices
- âœ… **Clean output management** with dedicated directories
- âœ… **Better maintainability** with clear file organization
- âœ… **Scalable architecture** for future development
- âœ… **Full compatibility** with existing functionality

The Contract Analyzer now has a clean, professional structure that separates concerns properly and follows industry standards for Python projects.
