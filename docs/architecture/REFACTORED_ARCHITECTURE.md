# Contract Analyzer - Refactored Architecture

## Overview

The Contract Analyzer has been completely refactored from a monolithic architecture to a clean, modular Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture. This document describes the new architecture, design patterns, and architectural decisions.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Domain Layer (`app/core/`)

The domain layer contains the core business logic and entities, independent of any external frameworks or technologies.

#### Models (`app/core/models/`)

**Contract Entity** (`contract.py`)
- Represents the contract domain entity with full lifecycle management
- Handles state transitions (uploaded → processing → analyzed → error)
- Contains business methods for validation, risk assessment, and metadata management
- Immutable data with controlled state mutations

**AnalysisResult Aggregate** (`analysis_result.py`)
- Aggregates contract analysis data with risk calculations
- Contains Change value objects representing individual modifications
- Implements business rules for risk level determination
- Provides summary and reporting capabilities

**Change Value Object** (`analysis_result.py`)
- Represents individual changes between template and contract
- Implements classification logic (Critical, Significant, Inconsequential)
- Contains change type detection (Insertion, Deletion, Modification)
- Provides business methods for impact assessment

#### Core Services (`app/core/services/`)

**ContractAnalyzer** (`analyzer.py`)
- Main orchestration service for contract analysis workflow
- Coordinates between DocumentProcessor, ComparisonEngine, and LLM providers
- Implements the primary business use case of contract analysis
- Maintains separation between business logic and infrastructure concerns

**DocumentProcessor** (`document_processor.py`)
- Domain service for document processing operations
- Handles text extraction, document validation, and preprocessing
- Provides structured content extraction and metadata generation
- Independent of specific document libraries (dependency inversion)

**ComparisonEngine** (`comparison_engine.py`)
- Domain service for text comparison and change detection
- Implements sophisticated diff algorithms and similarity calculations
- Provides word-level, sentence-level, and structural change detection
- Contains business logic for change significance filtering

### 2. Application Layer (`app/api/`)

The application layer orchestrates domain services and handles use cases.

#### API Routes (`app/api/routes/`)

**Contract Routes** (`contracts.py`)
- RESTful endpoints for contract management

- Integrates with LLM providers for AI-powered analysis

**Report Routes** (`reports.py`)
- Handles report generation in multiple formats
- Coordinates with report formatters for Excel, Word, and PDF output
- Provides download and streaming capabilities
- Implements proper content-type headers and file handling

### 3. Infrastructure Layer (`app/services/`)

The infrastructure layer handles external dependencies and technical concerns.

#### LLM Integration (`app/services/llm/`)

**Provider Pattern Implementation**
- `BaseLLMProvider` - Abstract interface for all LLM providers

- Proper error handling and rate limiting

#### Report Generation (`app/services/reports/`)

**Formatter Pattern Implementation**
- `ExcelReportFormatter` - Professional Excel reports with styling
- `WordReportFormatter` - Word documents with COM integration
- `PDFReportFormatter` - PDF generation with custom styling
- `ReportGenerator` - Orchestrates multi-format report generation

**Benefits:**
- Each formatter handles one responsibility
- Easy to add new report formats
- Consistent report structure across formats
- Platform-specific optimizations (Windows COM for Word)

#### Storage Management (`app/services/storage/`)

**FileManager** (`file_manager.py`)
- Handles all file operations with security validation
- Implements cleanup policies and storage monitoring
- Provides path traversal protection and safe file operations
- Manages file metadata and lifecycle

### 4. Configuration Layer (`app/config/`)

#### Settings Management (`settings.py`)
- Environment-based configuration with validation
- Type-safe configuration objects
- Configuration inheritance and overrides
- Validation and error reporting

#### Environment-Specific Configuration (`environments/`)
- Development, production, and testing configurations
- Environment-specific overrides and optimizations
- Secure defaults and validation rules

#### User Settings (`user_settings.py`)
- User-editable preferences separate from secure configuration
- LLM model selection and analysis parameters
- UI preferences and customization options
- Import/export capabilities for configuration management

## Design Patterns and Principles

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Entities and Value Objects**
- Contract: Entity with identity and lifecycle
- AnalysisResult: Aggregate root for analysis data
- Change: Value object for individual modifications

**Domain Services**
- ContractAnalyzer: Orchestrates complex business operations
- DocumentProcessor: Encapsulates document processing logic
- ComparisonEngine: Handles comparison algorithms

**Repository Pattern**
- Abstracted through service interfaces
- FileManager provides storage abstraction
- Easy to replace with database implementations

### SOLID Principles

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- Each class has one reason to change
- Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Extensible through provider pattern and factory methods
- New LLM providers and report formats can be added without modification

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- All LLM providers implement the same interface
- Report formatters are interchangeable

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- Small, focused interfaces for each concern
- Clients depend only on interfaces they use

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- Both depend on abstractions (interfaces)

### Additional Patterns

**Factory Pattern**
- LLM provider creation and configuration
- Report formatter instantiation
- Configuration object creation

**Strategy Pattern**
- Different analysis strategies based on document types
- Multiple comparison algorithms in ComparisonEngine

**Observer Pattern**
- Event-driven architecture for analysis workflow
- Status updates and progress tracking

## Benefits of the Refactored Architecture

### Type Safety
- Comprehensive type hints throughout
- Runtime type validation
- IDE support for refactoring and navigation

## Migration from Monolithic Architecture

- **Isolation**: Each test is independent and repeatable
- **Coverage**: All critical business logic covered
- **Fast Execution**: Unit tests run in milliseconds

## Future Considerations

### Microservices Evolution
The current modular architecture provides clear boundaries for potential microservice extraction:
- **Analysis Service**: Document processing and comparison
- **Report Service**: Multi-format report generation
- **LLM Service**: AI provider integration and management

### Database Integration
The repository pattern is abstracted through service interfaces, making it straightforward to add:
- PostgreSQL for transactional data
- Document databases for contract storage
- Caching layers for performance optimization

### Event-Driven Architecture
The current synchronous design can evolve to event-driven:
- Analysis workflow events
- Real-time status updates
- Audit trail generation

### Performance Optimizations
- Asynchronous processing for large documents
- Caching strategies for repeated analyses
- Batch processing capabilities

## Conclusion

The refactored architecture provides a solid foundation for the Contract Analyzer application with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive testing, and extensible design. The Domain-Driven Design approach ensures that business logic remains at the center while technical concerns are properly abstracted and manageable.

The architecture supports current requirements while providing a path for future enhancements and scalability needs.
